### Multi-Server Dashboard
A fast way to see all servers at once and manage them without digging through folders or terminals.

### Cluster / Multi-Node Support

###  Gallery
A built-in **Gallery** section for quickly accessing and managing supported items/content from the panel (designed to reduce digging through folders and configs).

### Panel Customization
Customize panel behavior and settings so it fits your setup (local-only use, multi-node, different install paths, etc.).

### Automatic Firewall Rule Handling (Windows)
Helps ensure the correct ports are allowed through Windows Firewall so servers can be reachable (when your router forwarding is set correctly).

## Recommended Network Setup (Safety)
Because this tool can manage servers remotely, best practice is to run it on a **separate VLAN** (or a dedicated “servers” network) away from your personal PCs/devices.

---

## Who This Is For
- People running one or more Nuclear Option servers
- Server owners who want a clean UI instead of manual scripts
- Communities using Discord and wanting easy admin tools
- Multi-machine setups (clustered servers)
- Anyone who wants simpler recording workflows via NOBlackBox
